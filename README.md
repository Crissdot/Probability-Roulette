# Probability Roulette

The other day, my little brother asked me this question "If we have a roulette with this gains [x2, x3, x5, x10, x20], what is the minimum amount I can bet and always win?"

    At least in the first 100,000 attempts is impossible and the difference between your bet and the minimum gain is always increasing
